\chapter{Conclusions and future work }

There is a lot of ongoing research on this topic and in various directions. Using the operators $a_{\bf{k}}({\bf{q}})$, we wish to create a formalism to re-derive the zero temperature, Green's function in the interaction picture and the Fermi-Dirac distribution. This might give us a further idea of how to take up research topics like the finite-temperature Green's function for the interaction picture. 

As an end goal, we want to generalize the results obtained in the Luttinger liquid model to many dimensions while resolving seemingly conflicting principles, that is, that the Sea-Boson formalism leads to a violation of the Area law of entanglement entropy. We hence need to work around this by using non-linear operators, which are non-local, justifying the name of this report. 

We conclude by saying that the path ahead of us is difficult, but we hope that as time progresses, we are able to explain in the least some news ways about thinking about many-body physics.
