# New technique to study many-body physics using non-local operators

This folder contains the LaTeX source and compiled PDF for the report. The report develops a formalism based on non-local particle–hole (sea-displacement) operators and surveys the foundational quantum-mechanical tools needed to motivate that approach.

## Chapter overview

### Chapter 1 — History and Introduction
Covers the historical lineage of bosonization and Luttinger-liquid ideas, then motivates the report’s goal: a non-perturbative formalism for many-particle Green’s functions using sea-displacement operators and non-local particle–hole excitations.

### Chapter 2 — Second quantization: Creation and annihilation operators
Introduces occupation-number representation, bosons vs. fermions, and Fock space, then derives the action and commutation relations of bosonic creation and annihilation operators to set the operator-based language used later.

### Chapter 3 — Non-local particle-hole creation operators
Defines the momentum-space notation, the filled Fermi sea, and sea-displacement operators that create particle–hole pairs. It then rewrites number-conserving operators in terms of these non-local operators and outlines their algebraic properties.

### Conclusions and future work
Summarizes the aim of using sea-displacement operators to re-derive Green’s functions and Fermi-Dirac distributions, and outlines future work on extending Luttinger-liquid results to higher dimensions while addressing entanglement-entropy constraints.

### Mathematical preliminaries
Provides formal definitions for second quantization and Fock space, along with notation used in the report’s operator constructions.
