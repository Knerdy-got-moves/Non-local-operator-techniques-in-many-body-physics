# Simple random pahse approximation (SRPA) vs Generalised random phase approximation (GRPA)

## Motivation
The SRPA vs GRPA comparison is motivated by how low-energy excitations in a Fermi system are dominated by particle–hole pairs near the Fermi level. Creating pairs well above the Fermi level is energetically costly and therefore unlikely, while creating pairs far below it is suppressed by the nearly full Fermi sea at near-zero temperatures. These physical constraints guide practical approximations and allow tractable calculations that still capture the relevant low-energy physics.

## Results
The approximations encoded in SRPA/GRPA focus attention on particle–hole excitations near the Fermi surface. This isolates the physics that governs low-energy collective modes and enables exploration of interaction effects (for example, the role of detailed interactions in superconductivity) without being dominated by high-energy processes that are unlikely in the relevant regimes.

## Conclusion
SRPA and GRPA approximations are rooted in the physical picture of a filled Fermi sea with accessible excitations concentrated near the Fermi level. By filtering out energetically disfavored particle–hole configurations, these approaches provide a controlled way to probe low-energy interaction effects while keeping the analysis feasible.
