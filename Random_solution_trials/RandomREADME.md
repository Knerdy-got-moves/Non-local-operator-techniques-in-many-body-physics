# Random Solution Trials

## Motivation
The goal of these trials is to identify operators that **exactly commute** when built from fermionic creation and annihilation operators in the momentum basis. To approach this, we attempt to express the fermionic creation/annihilation operators in terms of **Sea Boson operators**, which are known to almost commute. If such a mapping could be established, it would provide a path toward constructing commuting operators directly from the fermionic language.

## Content
This folder collects exploratory calculations and trial mappings aimed at rewriting fermionic operators in the Sea-Boson framework. The materials include multiple iterative attempts, alternative ansätze, and supporting notes that probe whether the near-commutativity of Sea Bosons can be leveraged to build exactly commuting operators.

## Results
The attempts were **not successful**. The main difficulty was **stiffness due to insufficient constraints**, which prevented a consistent and exact mapping from fermionic creation/annihilation operators to the Sea Boson operators. As a result, no operator set with exact commutation properties was found through these trials.

## Conclusion
While the Sea Boson operators offered an appealing starting point because of their near-commutativity, the lack of sufficient constraints in the mapping made the problem stiff and ultimately intractable in these trials. Further progress likely requires additional structure or constraints beyond the current setup.
