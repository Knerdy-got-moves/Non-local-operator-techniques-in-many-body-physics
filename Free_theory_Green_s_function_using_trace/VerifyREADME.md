# Free Theory Green's Function Using Trace

## Motivation
We verify the equations presented in the paper _“Fermions as a non-local particle hole-excitation”_ using the exact Green’s function computed via trace methods. This exercise does more than check algebra: it reveals the internal canceling structure required by the differential equations produced by our method, helping us understand why the final solutions must take the forms they do.

## Content
- Source and verification notes for equations on page 5 of the paper.
- LaTeX derivations that back-substitute into Eqs. 28 and 29.
- PDF exports of the verified equations (Eqs. 28–31).
- Reference to the paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06489

## Results
- The trace-based exact Green’s function reproduces the paper’s equations (Eqs. 28–31) as expected.
- The derivations expose systematic cancellations that align with the differential constraints, indicating a consistent internal structure of the solution.

## Conclusion
The trace calculation provides an independent, exact check of the paper’s key equations and highlights the cancellation patterns implied by our differential-equation approach. This reinforces confidence in the non-local operator framework and clarifies the structural requirements on admissible solutions.
